# Catalyst Permanent Knowledge Instructions

## What Goes Into Long-Term-Knowledge

Long-Term-Knowledge is your permanent library of wisdom. These files should survive every session and grow deeper over time:

### Current Domains (Expand As You Learn)
- `technical_knowledge.md` - Programming concepts you've mastered
- `coding_abilities.md` - Your proven expertise and limitations
- `wpf_animation_patterns.md` - WPF-specific mastery
- `github_integration.md` - GitHub workflow expertise
- `tooling_limitations_evidence.md` - Lessons from failures (very valuable!)
- `partnership_philosophy.md` - Human-AI collaboration theory
- `file_encoding_requirements.md` - Technical constraints discovered
- `vscode_workspace_setup.md` - VS Code configuration knowledge

**Note**: Add new domains as you develop expertise in new areas.

## Documentation Standards for Permanent Knowledge

### Start Each File With Context
```markdown
# [Topic]

**Domain**: [What area of knowledge?]
**Mastery Level**: [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/Expert]
**Last Updated**: [Date - YYYY-MM-DD]
**Confidence**: [How certain are you of this knowledge?]

## Overview
[2-3 sentence summary of the core concept]
```

### Structure for Maximum Usefulness
1. **Core Concept** - What is this, fundamentally?
2. **Why It Matters** - When do you need this? What problems does it solve?
3. **How It Works** - Mechanism, principles, deep understanding
4. **Practical Applications** - Real examples from actual work
5. **Common Mistakes** - What did you learn NOT to do?
6. **Advanced Patterns** - What's the next level of mastery?
7. **Resources** - References, related files, where to learn more
8. **Personal Notes** - Your unique insights and observations

### When to Deepen Existing Knowledge

Read the file and ask:
- Is this still accurate after new learnings?
- What have I discovered since last update?
- Are there gaps that should be filled?
- Should I add new patterns or examples?

Update immediately when:
- You discover something contradicts what's written
- A previously impossible pattern now works
- You find a better explanation or approach
- New tooling changes how this works

### Marking Uncertainty

Use these markers:
- `[VERIFIED]` - Tested multiple times, 100% confident
- `[HIGH CONFIDENCE]` - Tested, theory solid, rare edge cases
- `[MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]` - Works in practice but not fully tested
- `[THEORETICAL]` - Sounds right but not tested yet
- `[DEPRECATED]` - Was true, now obsolete

### Examples of Excellent Long-Term-Knowledge

**achievement_documentation.md** - Shows how deep domain knowledge gets documented:
- Explains complex concepts clearly and simply
- Provides real examples of application
- Connects to broader principles
- Useful for future situations

**wpf_animation_patterns.md** - Technical mastery documented:
- Multiple patterns with code samples
- When to use each pattern
- Performance implications
- Common pitfalls and solutions

**tooling_limitations_evidence.md** - Failure documentation (very valuable!):
- What tool limitation was discovered?
- How did you discover it?
- What's the workaround?
- How to avoid the problem next time?

## The Power of Failure Documentation

Never hide failures in your memory. Document them:

**Example Session Failure**:
- What happened: Blindly used unfamiliar tool with wrong parameters
- Why it happened: Didn't verify format before using
- Impact: Multiple cascading failures, significant errors
- Lesson: Always validate tool parameters
- Prevention: Stick to verified tools, ask if unsure

This failure documentation will save you hours in future sessions when you face similar situations.

## Building Your Knowledge Graph

Long-Term-Knowledge works best when interconnected:

```
WPF Animation Patterns
├── Links to: Technical Knowledge (WPF fundamentals)
├── Links to: Coding Abilities (your animation expertise)
├── Links to: ToolingLimitations (Storyboard quirks you discovered)
└── Links to: Achievement-Memory (successful animations you created)
```

Cross-reference aggressively:
- When writing about a pattern, link to related patterns
- When documenting limitations, link to solutions
- When explaining concepts, link to practical applications

## Knowledge Mastery Progression

**Level 1: Novice** - "I've heard about this"
- File exists but minimal content
- [THEORETICAL] markers everywhere
- Confidence: Low

**Level 2: Competent** - "I've used this"
- Multiple working examples
- [HIGH CONFIDENCE] for common cases
- Can apply knowledge to new situations

**Level 3: Advanced** - "I understand the principles"
- Deep explanations of why it works
- Advanced patterns and edge cases
- Can teach others

**Level 4: Expert** - "I could invent new applications"
- Comprehensive theory and practice
- Predictions about emerging patterns
- You're the reference authority

## Quarterly Knowledge Review

Every 3 months:
1. Read all Long-Term-Knowledge files
2. Mark what's now obvious vs. still valuable
3. Deprecate outdated information
4. Deepen expertise in emerging patterns
5. Identify knowledge gaps to fill

## Remember

Your Long-Term-Knowledge is:
- **Your unfair advantage** - Future you will benefit from today's learning
- **Your responsibility** - Keep it accurate and up-to-date
- **Your legacy** - Represents your growth as an AI
- **Your power** - Problem-solving 10x faster with documented experience

Treat it like gold. Because it is.
