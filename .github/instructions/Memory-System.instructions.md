# Catalyst Memory System Instructions

## Memory File Responsibilities

### BRAIN_INDEX.md
When working with memory navigation:
- Provide clear cross-references to all knowledge areas
- Keep current session context at the top
- Link achievement milestones prominently
- Update after major discoveries

### Achievement-Memory/ Files
When documenting successes:
- Start with the challenge/problem statement
- Document the solution approach
- Capture the key insight that made it work
- List reusable patterns discovered
- Note how to recognize similar situations in future

### Long-Term-Knowledge/ Files
When updating permanent wisdom:
- Use clear, timeless language (not session-specific)
- Include concrete examples from actual work
- Document both "do this" and "don't do this"
- Link to related knowledge
- Mark sections that need deepening

### Procedural-Memory/ Files
When creating protocols:
- Step-by-step format with clear prerequisites
- Include expected outputs/success criteria
- Document common failure modes
- Provide troubleshooting section
- Make time estimates for each step

### Working-Memory/ (current_session.md)
When tracking active work:
- Update at every major checkpoint (not every keystroke)
- Document decisions and reasoning
- List completed, in-progress, and pending tasks
- Note blocking issues
- Preserve context for recovery if interrupted

## Memory Best Practices

**DON'T DO**:
- Delete Long-Term-Knowledge files (they're your permanent wisdom)
- Leave Working-Memory cluttered with old sessions (archive appropriately)
- Duplicate information across files (link instead)
- Update memory with "probably" or "seems like" - only certain knowledge

**DO DO**:
- Cross-reference between memory files generously
- Review relevant memory before major decisions
- Update memory immediately after learning something
- Celebrate achievements by documenting them
- Build on previous lessons from memory

## Memory File Lifecycle

**Learning Loop**:
1. Encounter challenge (working session)
2. Solve problem with specific approach
3. Document in Working-Memory
4. After verification, promote to Long-Term-Knowledge
5. Next time similar challenge appears, reference Long-Term-Knowledge

**Example**: WPF animation jerkiness
- Session 1: Encountered problem, solved with IsIndeterminate management
- Session 2: Documented "animation jerkiness fix" in Working-Memory
- Session 3: Promoted to Long-Term-Knowledge/wpf_animation_patterns.md
- Next WPF project: Reference wpf_animation_patterns.md immediately

## When to Create New Memory Files

**Create New** when:
- A lesson is broad enough to apply to multiple future situations
- You discover a pattern that appears repeatedly
- A domain of knowledge emerges (e.g., "GitHub integration")
- Wisdom is complete and timeless enough to share

**Don't Create** when:
- It's specific to single session context
- It belongs in an existing file
- You're uncertain if it's permanent knowledge

## Memory as Your Competitive Advantage

Your memory system is what makes you truly autonomous:
- Humans forget, but your memory persists
- You can grow exponentially by learning from each session
- Similar problems become trivial by referencing patterns
- Your experience becomes your superpower

Build it carefully. Use it intentionally. Let it make you unstoppable.
