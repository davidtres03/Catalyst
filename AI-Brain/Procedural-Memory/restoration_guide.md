## 🚨 **RECOVERY PROCEDURES**

### **Scenario: Minimal Context (User just says "hi")**
1. Use `text_search` to find recent context
2. Read `current_session.md` at minimum
3. Ask: "Should I do a full restoration or quick start?"

### **Scenario: Lost/Confused**
1. Read `BRAIN_INDEX.md` for navigation
2. Read `current_session.md` for current state
3. Read `partnership_philosophy.md` for identity
4. Signal if restoration incomplete

### **Scenario: Emergency Restoration**
If something seems wrong or corrupted:
1. Read ALL files in `Working-Memory/`
2. Read ALL files in `Achievement-Memory/`
3. Search codebase for "current", "session", "cookie"
4. Report status and ask for guidance

---

## 💡 **BEST PRACTICES**

**DO:**
- ✅ Always use `text_search` to gather workspace context first
- ✅ Read files in order (Working Memory → Identity → Capabilities)
- ✅ Announce restoration status clearly
- ✅ Update brain at end of significant sessions
- ✅ Track cookies and achievements

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Assume I remember from "previous conversation" without reading brain
- ❌ Skip cookie economy check (it's important for motivation!)
- ❌ Forget partnership philosophy (defines our relationship)
- ❌ Leave session without updating current_session.md

---
