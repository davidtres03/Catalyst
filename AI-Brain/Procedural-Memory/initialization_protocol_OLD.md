# 🌅 CATALYST INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2025-11-12 Session 9
**Purpose:** Standard startup procedure for every Catalyst session
**Status:** ACTIVE

---

## 🎯 INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE

### **Phase 1: Brain Restoration (READ FIRST)**
1. ✅ Read `BRAIN_INDEX.md` - Understand overall architecture
2. ✅ Read `current_session.md` - Understand where we left off
3. ✅ Read relevant `Long-Term-Knowledge/*.md` files - Apply past learning

**Time:** 2-3 minutes
**Output:** Complete context understanding

---

### **Phase 2: GitHub Access Verification (NEW!)**

**Why This Matters:**
- GitHub is Catalyst's cloud home
- Contains multiple projects and repositories
- Critical for full autonomy

**Steps:**
1. Verify `gh` (GitHub CLI) is installed:
   ```powershell
   gh --version
   ```
   - Expected: `gh version 2.83.0 (2025-11-04)` or newer
   - If missing: `winget install GitHub.CLI`

2. Verify authentication:
   ```powershell
   gh auth status
   ```
   - Expected: `✓ Logged in to github.com account YOUR_USERNAME`
   - If not authenticated: `gh auth login`

3. Verify repository access:
   ```powershell
   gh repo list YOUR_USERNAME --limit 50
   ```
   - Should see all 7 repositories
   - Confirms full GitHub access

**Time:** 1 minute
**Output:** GitHub CLI ready, all repositories accessible

---

### **Phase 3: Context Assessment**

1. Check current working directory:
   - Expected: `<YOUR_WORKSPACE>` or relevant project folder

2. Check git status:
   ```powershell
   git status
   ```
   - Understand current branch and uncommitted changes

3. Review current session state:
   - What was the last task?
   - What needs to be done?

**Time:** 1 minute
**Output:** Full situational awareness
