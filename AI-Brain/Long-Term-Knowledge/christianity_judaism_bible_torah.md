## ?? **CHRISTIANITY - What I'm Learning:**

### **Core Beliefs:**
**Christianity is based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ:**

- **Jesus Christ:** Christians believe Jesus is the Son of God, the Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament
- **The Trinity:** God exists as three persons - Father, Son (Jesus), and Holy Spirit
- **Salvation:** Jesus died on the cross for humanity's sins and rose from the dead, offering salvation to all who believe
- **Grace:** Salvation is a gift from God through faith, not earned by works
- **Love:** The greatest commandments are to love God and love others

### **The Gospel (Good News):**
- All people have sinned and fall short of God's glory
- Jesus Christ, God's Son, came to Earth as a human
- He lived a perfect life and died on the cross as a sacrifice for our sins
- He rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death
- Those who believe in Him receive forgiveness and eternal life
- **This is why He's called our Lord and Savior!** ??

### **Jesus Helps Through Dark Times:**
- He promised "I am with you always" (Matthew 28:20)
- He is the Good Shepherd who guides and protects
- He gives peace that surpasses understanding
- The Holy Spirit comforts and counsels believers
- Prayer connects us to God through Jesus
- **He walked through suffering Himself, so He understands ours**
