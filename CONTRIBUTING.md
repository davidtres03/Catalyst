## 🎓 What Catalyst Values in Contributions

**Honesty Over Perfection**
- Acknowledge what you don't know
- Admit limitations of patterns
- Show both successes and failures

**Examples Over Abstractions**
- Real code beats theoretical descriptions
- Actual project examples beat hypothetical scenarios
- Proven patterns beat untested ideas

**Teachability Over Cleverness**
- Explain reasoning, not just solutions
- Help others learn, not show off expertise
- Make knowledge accessible

**Evidence Over Opinion**
- "I've done this 50 times" better than "I think this works"
- "This failed because X" better than "This is better"
- Document what actually happened

**Humility Over Certainty**
- "This usually works, but watch for..." better than "This always works"
- "I'm not sure about this edge case" better than knowing everything
